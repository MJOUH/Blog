        Disneyland Park is a collection of adventures, rides, and shows symbolized by the Disney characters and Sleeping Beauty Castle. It's divided into nine subareas, or "lands," arranged around a central hub. First encountered is Main Street, U.S.A., which connects the Disneyland entrance with the central hub.</p>

While I walked away happy from my first True Food Kitchen dining experience, I left truly awed by this showcase of gluten-free and vegan food. Each course was a masterpiece, and although I couldn’t eat every bite, I had no regrets leaving with a huge food food coma, completely stuffed and completely happy. </p>

      <p>Why it rocks:
        The idea for a movie where the protagonist is a villain who has a change of heart is very original and creative.
        The movie's script is very entertaining and well-written, as it has some pretty funny quotes.
        Many of the characters are likable and fun, especially for Gru and three orphan kids.
        In fact, Gru is a sympathetic character and his motivations for being a villain are understandable.
        The Minions can make you laugh in most of the scenes, and their relationship with Gru and his adopted daughters is very heartwarming.
        One of the orphan girls, Agnes is absolutely adorable.
        The humor is hilarious and creative. Even some of the bathroom humor is funny, with Gru's plan being one example.
        The animation (even when it is produced in CGI) is pretty decent, especially considering it was the first movie by Illumination Entertainment.
        Vector is a really hilarious villain who has many memorable lines (such as "Oh yeah!").
        Many of the film's actions scenes are quite amazing to watch, especially the scene when Gru steals the shrinking ray.
        The vocal performances are very fantastic and quite amazing as everyone brings a great job of their character.
        The relationship with Gru and the orphan girls is one of the cutest and emotional moments of the film.
        Many of the other emotional scenes are pretty wholesome.
        A lot of Pharrell Williams songs are very astounding, some of them are "Fun, Fun, Fun", "Prettiest Girls" and "My Life" by Robin Thicke.
        Heitor Periera's score in the movie is very vivid and awesomely moving.
        "I will stuff you all in the crust!"</p>
